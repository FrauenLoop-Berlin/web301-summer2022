# Training Version Control

## Add your bio in alphabetic order
This is an exercise to learn how to work colaborativelly using git as a version control system.

You need to add your name and one line about you in alphabetic order.

You will do that in 2 stages: first you will add your name. You never change the master branch! You create a branch, commit your change, push it the remote branch, open a pull request, wait for approval, than you finally merge. Second part you will add one paragraph about you.

Before creating a new branch you pull changes from master, make sure you are up to date. Than you repeat the process.

Useful commands:
- [] git pull
- [] git push
- [] git status
- [] git log
